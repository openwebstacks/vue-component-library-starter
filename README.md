# Vue Component Library Starter

Vue Starter helps kick-start & maintain development of your next Vue component library. It is the most simple & comfortable solution for Vue developers to build highly-modular, widely-accepted & scalable component libraries. No matter whether you are a beginner or an expert, Stacks' approachable design allows you to learn more about its capabilities as you develop your library.

> _The clever way to build component libraries._

Develop beautiful reactive composable UIs without learning a new language. HTML, CSS, sprinkled with minimal JavaScript‚Äîdive in now!

## ‚òòÔ∏è Features

The ultimate goal of this Starter Kit is to _help you_ create a component library. It is a ah optimized build process that automatically generates `.mjs` & `.cjs` library distributions for you, including its types. Other core features include:

- Automagically builds & distributes Vue 2 & 3 libraries for you
- Zero-config by default, yet highly-configurable‚Äîif needed
- Delightful Developer Experience _(DX)_
- Style with ease via UnoCSS _(e.g. Tailwind CSS, Windi CSS, Heroicons, Bootstrap, etc.)_
- Modern git commit conventions
- Automated npm package releases & semver versioning
- Pretty changelog generations _(markdown & GitHub releases)_
- Fully-typed, automatically _(your components & composables)_
- Optimized & automated GitHub PR dependency updates
- Bootstrapped documentation tooling & site to present library _(via VitePress)_

## üí° Get Started

It's incredibly easy to get started. The only prerequisite is a basic understanding HTML & JavaScript. In other words, there is virtually no learning curve because "HTML with sprinkled JavaScript" will get you _incredibly_ far.

```bash
# you may "Use this template" via the button in top right corner of this page
# or run the following commands:
npx degit openwebstacks/vue-starter hello-world-stack
cd hello-world-stack
npm run setup # WIP
```

## ü§ñ Usage

The following is a list of the most common ways to use interact with Stacks

```bash
pnpm install # install all dependencies (for all packages/workspaces)
pnpm fresh # fresh reinstall of all dependencies

pnpm dev # stubs the libraries for local use
pnpm build # builds the library for production-ready use
pnpm example # run one of the examples (follow CLI prompts)

pnpm commit # follow CLI prompts for committing changes
pnpm release # releases the library (packages) to npm

pnpm docs:dev # starts local server for the documentation site
pnpm docs:build # builds the documentation site
pnpm docs:serve # serves the documentation site
```

_The `package.json` may contain additional useful snippets you want to be aware of._

Because we optimize toward the development of easily reusable & composable component libraries, our primary intention is always _keep it simple, yet configurable_:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import HelloWorld from '@ow3/hello-world-vue'
</script>

<template>
  <HelloWorld name="J Doe" />
</template>
```

Read more about the setup & tips in the docs.

### Developer Experience (DX)

This Starter Kit is a Component-First, UI & Build Framework. When developing your own library, this Starter Kit bootstraps the following for you:

- [Be a Good Commitizen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/git-cz) - pre-configured Commitizen & git-cz setup to simplify semantic git commits, versioning, and changelog generations
- [Built With Testing In Mind](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest) - pre-configured unit-testing powered by [Vitest](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest) & e2e-testing by [Cypress](https://cypress.io/)
- [Renovate](https://renovatebot.com/) - optimized & automated PR dependency updates
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) - runs your CI (fixes code style issues, tags releases & creates its changelogs, runs the test suite, etc.
